### Using Algorithms.

- Perceive security as a chain, including communications security, information security, data security, etc.
- Cryptographic algorithms, protocols, key management, and other aspects all need to be safe.
- As the creator of a secure system, you must consider every potential avenue of attack and take precautions against each one, whereas a cryptanalyst only needs to uncover one loophole and exploit it.
- Any clever cryptoanalyst will attempt to break your system if your algorithms are excellent but your random number generator is terrible.
- A cryptanalyst will be able to crack your system through that gap if you close the hole but neglect to safely erase a memory location that houses the key.
